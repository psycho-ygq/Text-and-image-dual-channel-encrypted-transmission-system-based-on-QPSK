# Text-and-image-dual-channel-encrypted-transmission-system-based-on-QPSK

This experiment utilizes ALM-PLUTO to achieve selective text transmission and encrypted image transmission functionality.

# At the Transmitter:

(1) For text：

First, convert the text and characters into binary encoding.

Interleave the data and map it to QPSK signals, then add training symbols for phase offset correction.

Perform QPSK modulation and send the signals through a transmission filter using txPluto() to the PLUTO device.

(2) For JPG images：

First, convert the data from the three channels of the image into a binary code stream for transmission.

Encrypt the transmission code using a symmetric encryption algorithm with keys generated by logistic chaos.

Segment the data to be transmitted.

Add a marker sequence for bit error rate testing before the image data.

Interleave the data and map it to QPSK signals, then add training symbols for phase offset correction.

Perform QPSK modulation and send the signals through a transmission filter using txPluto() to the PLUTO device.

# At the Receiver:

Use the PLUTO rxPluto() function to receive the raw data, calculate the cross-correlation function to determine the position of the synchronization header, and extract the useful data.

Use MATLAB's built-in freqComp() function for coarse frequency offset correction.

After passing through a reception filter, use MATLAB's built-in symbolSync() function for sample decision, then correct the phase offset with the training symbols to obtain the required data.

Further demodulate, reassemble, and decrypt the received image data, and analyze the bit error rate.
