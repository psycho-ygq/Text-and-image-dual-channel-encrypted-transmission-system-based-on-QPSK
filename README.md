# At the Transmitter:

(1) For text：

First, convert the text and characters into binary encoding.

Interleave the data and map it to QPSK signals, then add training symbols for phase offset correction.

Perform QPSK modulation and send the signals through a transmission filter using txPluto() to the PLUTO device.

(2) For JPG images：

First, convert the data from the three channels of the image into a binary code stream for transmission.

Encrypt the transmission code using a symmetric encryption algorithm with keys generated by logistic chaos.

Segment the data to be transmitted.

Add a marker sequence for bit error rate testing before the image data.

Interleave the data and map it to QPSK signals, then add training symbols for phase offset correction.

Perform QPSK modulation and send the signals through a transmission filter using txPluto() to the PLUTO device.

# At the Receiver:

Use the PLUTO rxPluto() function to receive the raw data, calculate the cross-correlation function to determine the position of the synchronization header, and extract the useful data.

Use MATLAB's built-in freqComp() function for coarse frequency offset correction.

After passing through a reception filter, use MATLAB's built-in symbolSync() function for sample decision, then correct the phase offset with the training symbols to obtain the required data.

Further demodulate, reassemble, and decrypt the received image data, and analyze the bit error rate.

# Result

1. The received signal may experience a carrier frequency offset due to the mismatch between the transmitter and receiver, which causes a global rotation in the constellation diagram. We first apply a coarse frequency offset correction.

2. The sampling points in the communication system may not align with the symbol intervals, leading to a blurred constellation and dispersed symbol points. We address this issue by performing symbol timing recovery.

3. Even after correcting the frequency offset, a constant phase offset may still exist due to channel effects or hardware imperfections (e.g., a fixed rotation angle). Therefore, carrier phase recovery is also necessary.

After correcting frequency offset, phase offset, and symbol timing, the constellation points become highly concentrated around the ideal positions, indicating high signal quality and low bit error rate.

The constellation points are distributed in a cloud-like manner around the ideal positions, indicating the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in the channel, which causes the received signal to deviate from the ideal values. Since most of the points are concentrated near the ideal positions, it suggests that the reception quality is relatively good.
